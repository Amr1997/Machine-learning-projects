## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have worked on, ranging from beginner-level projects to more advanced ones. These projects cover a range of topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and more.

## Projects

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

</p>

In this project, I used a dataset of Titanic passenger information to predict whether a passenger would survive the sinking of the Titanic or not. I used a logistic regression model to make predictions based on features such as age, gender, and passenger class.

### 2. Handwritten Digit Recognition

</p>

In this project, I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. I used PyTorch to build and train the model, achieving an accuracy of over 98% on the test set.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis

</p>

In this project, I used natural language processing techniques to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. I used a combination of feature engineering and machine learning algorithms to classify reviews as positive or negative.

### 4. Image Classification

</p>

In this project, I used transfer learning to classify images of dogs and cats. I fine-tuned a pre-trained ResNet model using the PyTorch library, achieving an accuracy of over 90% on the test set.

### 5. Clustering

</p>

In this project, I used unsupervised learning techniques to cluster customer data into different segments. I used K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.

### 6. Credit Card Fraud Detection

</p>

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. I used a combination of oversampling techniques and a Random Forest classifier to achieve high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

## Running the Projects

Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a README file with instructions on how to run the project. Most of the projects require Python and the necessary libraries to be installed, such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch.
